DESCRIPTION

        REViVeTool is a macOS Feature Configuration Tool where you can toggle
        features that are included in latest macOS builds but are not shown
        to the user. It is safe to run, and supports a wide range of togglable
        settings and features. This is completely supported on macOS, however
        Apple did not intend users to access them.

INSTALLATION

        To use REViVeTool, head over to the Releases tab
        (https://github.com/therealandreww/REViVeTool/releases/tag/v0.3.2)
        where you can download the latest version of REViVe. It is a
        precompiled version of the application in the form of a *nix binary.
        The native code is supported through Linux, however does nothing as
        Linux distributions do not have such "tweakable" features included.

        Once downloaded, you may use the following command to list arguments
        required for the program to process the input.
